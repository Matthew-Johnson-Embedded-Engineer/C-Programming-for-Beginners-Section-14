Section 14: Reading from a File
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reading Characters from a Text File

	- the fgetc() function reads a character from a text file
	  that has been opened for reading 

	- takes a file pointer as its only argument and returns
	  the character read as type int

	int mchar = fgetc(pfile); // reads a character into mchar with pfile a File pointer

	- the mchar is type int because EOF will be returned if 
	  the end of the file has been reached

	- the function getc(), which is equivalent to fgetc(), 
	  is also available

		+ requires an argument of type FILE* and returns
		  the character read as type int

		+ virtually identifical to fgetc()

		+ only difference between them is that getc()
		  may be implemented as a macro, whereas fgetc()
		  is a function

	- you can read the contents of a file again when 
	  necessary

		+ the rewind() function positions the file that
		  is specified by the file pointer argument at
		  the beginning

	rewind(pfile);
